# Glossary

The words used across this design. Where a word already means something to attendees,
the design keeps that meaning; where the code needs a word attendees never see, it is
marked _(internal)_.

| Term                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Site**                  | One installation. Has settings, persons, events, API tokens.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Event**                 | One conference or weekend, with days, places, phases and participants. Never used for "something that happened in the system" — that is a _change_.                                                                                |
| **Day**                   | A calendar date of an event in the event's time zone, with a bookable window and a slot grid.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Phase**                 | Proposal, voting or scheduling. Derived from the event's phase windows and the clock, never stored as state.                                                                                                                       |
| **Place**                 | Somewhere a session or meeting happens: a room, an area, a meeting point, or "anywhere". Has floor, directions, capacity, a map pin, and which uses it allows. Replaces today's _location_ and _meeting point_.                    |
| **Venue**                 | An event's places plus its map image and general directions.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Person**                | A human known to the site. Site-wide; profile lives here.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Participation**         | A person's membership in one event, with their event role (attendee, organizer) and per-event preferences. Replaces _guest_ and the event↔guest assignment.                                                                        |
| **Actor** _(internal)_    | Who is acting in a request: a person with an assurance level and roles, a bot with token scopes, or the system.                                                                                                                    |
| **Assurance**             | How sure the server is that the actor is the person: _claimed_ (picked a name) or _verified_ (join link, code, password or passkey).                                                                                               |
| **Proposal**              | An idea for a session, with hosts, votes and comments. Owned by the proposals module.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Vote**                  | Interested / Maybe / Skip, one per participant per proposal. Private to the voter; aggregated for hosts.                                                                                                                           |
| **Session**               | Something placed on the schedule. Has a **kind**: _session_ (a talk, workshop, discussion), _shift_ (a volunteer slot needing a minimum headcount), or _fixture_ (an organizer item everyone sees, such as a meal or the opening). |
| **RSVP**                  | A public commitment to attend a session. Counts toward capacity. Can be _anonymous_ (counts, name hidden).                                                                                                                         |
| **Mark**                  | A private annotation by a person on a session, proposal or person: _star_ (interested, on my agenda), _hide_ (not for me), _note_ (free text). Never visible to anyone else, never counted.                                        |
| **Agenda**                | A person's own view: sessions they host or RSVP'd or starred, fixtures, confirmed meetings, with clashes computed. A derived view, not stored.                                                                                     |
| **Meeting**               | A 1-on-1 between two persons in a slot at a place, with a request → accepted / declined / lapsed / cancelled lifecycle.                                                                                                            |
| **Booking rule**          | What may be placed where and when: bookable windows per day, bookable places, maximum length, and **reserved windows** (place × time range × restriction, e.g. "spontaneous sessions only, bookable from one hour before").        |
| **Policy** _(internal)_   | A pure function deciding a rule: `(actor, subject, context) → allow \| deny(reason)`. Lives in `domain`, used by server and client.                                                                                                |
| **Change** _(internal)_   | A recorded fact: something that happened, with a type, subject, actor, time, payload and audience. Committed in the same transaction as the state it describes. What other systems call a domain event.                            |
| **Change log**            | The append-only table of changes, ordered by sequence number. Source of the change feed, of reactions, of notifications, and of the audit trail.                                                                                   |
| **Change feed**           | The per-viewer SSE stream of changes the viewer's audience permits, resumable from a sequence number.                                                                                                                              |
| **Audience**              | Who may see a change: the public (public-schedule events only), everyone in the event, a set of persons, a session's hosts, the event's organizers.                                                                                |
| **Snapshot**              | Everything in the viewer's audience for one event, at one sequence number. What the client loads before subscribing.                                                                                                               |
| **Replica**               | The client's local copy of a snapshot kept current by the feed. Persisted so the app opens offline.                                                                                                                                |
| **Reaction** _(internal)_ | A handler in one module that runs after a change from another module was committed, at least once, idempotently. How modules cooperate without calling each other.                                                                 |
| **Notification**          | An in-app record telling one person something. Delivered additionally over the channels they bound: email, push, chat.                                                                                                             |
| **Channel**               | A way to reach a person outside the app: email, web push, a chat platform. Each is an adapter behind one port.                                                                                                                     |
| **Use case** _(internal)_ | One command or query in a module's application layer: authorize, load, apply the domain, record changes, respond. The only thing HTTP, jobs and other modules may call.                                                            |
| **Kernel** _(internal)_   | The server's shared code: unit of work, change log, clock, ids, actor context, errors.                                                                                                                                             |
